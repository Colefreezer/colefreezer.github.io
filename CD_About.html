                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I’m a creator at heart, developing my design and technical skills since I was 14. 
                Currently in my third year of the Mobile Application Development program at St. 
                Clair College, I’m studying Computer Science and continually expanding my skill set. 
                Alongside my studies, I’ve been teaching myself 3D modeling and game development techniques 
                to create the best games I can envision. </p>
                
                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I’ve worked on multiple games and personal projects over the years, including Heartsick and 
                Clockwork Shadows. From 2D RPGs to 3D immersive sims, I’m able to cover a range of genres. 
                I’ve also contributed to other projects with 3D modeling and sound design, creating music, 
                ambient tracks, and sound effects, giving me a foundational understanding of audio design on 
                top of everything else.</p>
